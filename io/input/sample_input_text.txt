##O Livro Mais Incrível Que Você Vai Ler (The Most Amazing Book You'll Ever Read)
# Livros Simplesmente Não Conseguem Ficar Melhores do Que Isso (Books Simply Can't Get Any Better Than This)
By Memorable Name
Brace yourself really hard before embarking on this reading journey because your mind is about to be completely blown by the most unbelievable discoveries humans have ever put in a book. None of these discoveries are anything short of amazing and every single line will be an unforgettable experience on its own, forever to be remembered and "nostalgiated" about. # This work is targetted at:
- Whoever can read;
- Whoever can't read but have someone else to read for them;
- My mom.
Now... don't get me wrong: I know you're already tired and can barely keep up after the untoucheable awesomeness of the first paragraph, and thinks that there can't possibly be anything more ground-skies-and-soul-shaking than that... W-r-o-n-g. Remember: The first person to climb a tree thought he was at the top of the world, just to find out, later, that between 51% and 91% of destruction of the Amazon forest comes from animal agriculture and that meat consumption is simply unsustainable. So minds will be blown.
# What does this book has to offer?
- We haven't found a compelling answer to that question yet. We'll get back to you, if we happen to find one.
Meanwhile, you can skip this whole section because it's really just some gibberish written * on-the-fly *that could've easily been generated by a #machine learning-driven program... but it's not: A human being, with his limited time on this planet, has actually wasted his time writing this, by hand, even wasting your time for making it comprehensible enough that made you keep reading it to perhaps see what was gonna come next or hoping it would, at some point, get to a punch line and make sense.(sorry for that :P) For real, now... just skip the remainder 'cause I got tired and it's all Lorem Ipsum from here. Bye bye! Thanks for taking the time!
