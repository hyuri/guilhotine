# Guilhotine
## Bechapter Your Books!

#### About
Export the chapters of a book* into individual files along with its associated metadata.

*Currently, only supports an in-house very specific format

#### Implementation details
Written in Python(3.6+), and the GUI version uses tkinter.

You can run it in GUI mode or CLI mode(check the docs for instructions).

Lots of things can be improved. I wrote it for a very specific job that required even less.
