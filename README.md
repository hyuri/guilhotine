# Guilhotine
## Bechapter Your Books!

#### About
Extract and export the chapters of books* into individual files along with its associated metadata.

*Currently, only supports an in-house very specific format

#### Implementation details
Written in Python(3.6+), and the GUI version uses tkinter.

You can run it in GUI mode or CLI mode(check the docs for instructions).

Lots of things can be improved. I wrote it for a very specific job that required way less but I went the extra mile and made it a little fancier, with a GUI and support for "remembering" last used paths, for practice.
